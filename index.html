            Hello Sam, I wanted to make this since well of course I'm a
            programmer and I wanted to make things special and much more cooler.
            hehe. Hopefully, it reaches to your standards. If not I'll make sure
            to be up to that standard then, hehe. (I'll make it better).<br /><br />
            I hope you are doing well. I know you lack sleep and wake up late
            sometimes, we can sleep together in call of course since we are
            miles apart.
            <br />
            <br />
            I want to hug you, hold you, kiss you and many more but
            unfortunately we are miles apart. I know there are times our plans
            don't go the way it's supposed to be but every moment I spend with
            you is worth it. I love hearing your voice and your funny giggles
            and awkward flirty jokes too.(it's really adorable)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h1 class="line-1 anim-typewriter">Sleepyhead Wabi</h1>
          <p class="Paragraph">
            I noticed that sometimes you sleep late which is not good soooo how
            about we sleep together whehehe, virtually at the moment (ugh..
            distance). I enjoy the times we played together even if we are not
            that vocal. Simply just being with you makes me feel better.
            <br />
            The long hours of us just in a call even if you were still asleep,
            I'd just imagine you were actually here with me. Isn't it odd that
            you somehow managed to nudge my heart? It was quite unexpected but
            not unwelcomed.
            <br /><br />
            These past few days, we haven't exactly spent as much time together
            and it makes me anxious then again we our time isn't always going to
            be free but for you I'll find a way to spend time with you. I know
            sometimes I feel distant but I think it has become a weird coping
            mechanism to just stay away if something feels off, I am going to
            work on that.

      <h1 class="Title-About">Things I Cherish About My Lover</h1>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        There are countless reasons why I cherish my lover.er infectious
        laughter brightens even the dullest days, and her kindness towards
        others is truly inspiring. I love how she always knows the right thing
        to say to lift my spirits, and her unwavering support makes me feel like
        I can conquer anything. Her passion for her interests is contagious, and
        I admire her dedication and drive. We share countless inside jokes that
        make our time together feel special and unique. Whether we’re having
        deep conversations or simply enjoying a quiet moment, her presence
        brings me a sense of peace and happiness. I cherish the way she sees the
        beauty in the little things and how she encourages me to do the same.
        Overall, her warmth, intelligence, and genuine nature make me feel
        incredibly lucky to have her in my life.

        <br /><br />
        I appreciate her sense of humor, which perfectly complements mine,
        making even the simplest activities feel like an adventure. The way she
        expresses her love, whether through small gestures or heartfelt words,
        makes me feel valued and understood. I also admire her intelligence and
        curiosity
        <br /><br />
        Ultimately, it’s her authenticity that draws me in the most. She is
        unapologetically herself, and that confidence is incredibly attractive.
        I feel a deep connection with her, and I am grateful for the love and
        companionship we share. Every day with her is a new opportunity to
        discover more about each other and to deepen our bond, and I can’t
        imagine my life without her by my side.

      <h1 class="Title-About">Our time together</h1>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        I'm really glad that I met you, My past has changed me because of my
        previous relationships but ever since I've met you, everything felt so
        new. I thought I would be closing my heart from opening up for anyone
        else but I realized that if I do, will I ever experience what love
        actually is? Of course it comes in many forms. As I started to get to
        know you more, the more I see the real you.
        <br /><br />
        We're not perfect beings, we make mistakes and we learn from it. Hearing
        from you makes me happy whether it's a bad day, good or boring, just
        hearing your voice is enough. Despite the distance I'm willing to love
        every part of you, the real you. So many days have passed, I've gotten
        to know you more. You care, your kind, despite with what you've gone
        through, you still manage to keep going. <br /><br />

        Please don't say you're a bad person. I see you differently, you are
        real, raw, I know it sounds weird but I see you with no filter, you are
        able to open up to me and it means a lot that you are able to trust me
        enough to tell me your problems. I know I need to work on that as well,
        to tell you my problems too, it is unfair that you are able to tell me
        yours when I myself can't even tell you. I'm sorry, it takes time for me
        to tell you my problems. Thank you for being here with me, for
        encouraging me to be better too. I'm getting nervous as our special day
        is coming. <br /><br />

        Let me recall the things I've said to you. <br />
        I just want you to know something really important. I’m not here for the
        gifts or money. That stuff doesn’t matter to me. What matters is you.
        Your time, your heart, your presence—that’s more than enough. You don’t
        have to prove your worth through material things. Just being you is
        already a gift in my life. I want this to work because I care about us,
        not what we can give each other in terms of money, but what we give
        emotionally, mentally, and with love.

        <br /><br />
        That’s all I need. I know you’ve been through things that made you
        question if you’re enough, especially when it comes to giving. But I
        need you to hear this ha?you are enough. You don’t have to give me
        anything material to be worthy of love. Just you being you..your heart,
        your honesty, the way you care ..that’s more than enough for me. I’m not
        here for what you can give. I’m here because of who you are. And I’m not
        going anywhere just because life isn’t perfect. I see you. I value you.
        And I’m thankful for you, always.
        <br /><br />
        So even if no one’s made you feel assured before… let me start. I choose
        you. Not because of what you can give—but because of what you already
        are Sometimes I think of this too… like what if things don’t work out?
        What if we fall short in ways we can’t control? But then I remind
        myself: love isn’t measured by money or gifts. It’s measured by effort,
        by care, by choosing each other even when it’s hard. I don’t need gifts.
        I don’t need anything fancy. I just need you, real and honest. So if you
        ever feel like you’re not enough, please let me remind you… you already
        are.<br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        I've started to realize that my feelings have deepened... you showed me
        what you really are, not entirely everything but by pieces, I know we
        are far from each other but I'm willing to keep this going and make us
        more than what we are now.
      </p>
