            Hello Sam, I wanted to make this since well of course I'm a
            programmer and I wanted to make things special and much more cooler.
            hehe. Hopefully, it reaches to your standards. If not I'll make sure
            to be up to that standard then, hehe. (I'll make it better).<br /><br />
            I hope you are doing well. I know you lack sleep and wake up late
            sometimes, we can sleep together in call of course since we are
            miles apart.
            <br />
            <br />
            I want to hug you, hold you, kiss you and many more but
            unfortunately we are miles apart. I know there are times our plans
            don't go the way it's supposed to be but every moment I spend with
            you is worth it. I love hearing your voice and your funny giggles
            and awkward flirty jokes too.(it's really adorable)
          </p>

            I noticed that sometimes you sleep late which is not good soooo how
            about we sleep together whehehe, virtually at the moment (ugh..
            distance). I enjoy the times we played together even if we are not
            that vocal. Simply just being with you makes me feel better.
            <br />
            The long hours of us just in a call even if you were still asleep,
            I'd just imagine you were actually here with me. Isn't it odd that
            you somehow managed to nudge my heart? It was quite unexpected but
            not unwelcomed.
            <br /><br />
            These past few days, we haven't exactly spent as much time together
            and it makes me anxious then again we our time isn't always going to
            be free but for you I'll find a way to spend time with you. I know
            sometimes I feel distant but I think it has become a weird coping
            mechanism to just stay away if something feels off, I am going to
            work on that.

      <h1 class="Title-About">Our time together</h1>
      <p class="Paragraph">
        I'm really glad that I met you, My past has changed me because of my
        previous relationships but ever since I've met you, everything felt so
        new. I thought I would be closing my heart from opening up for anyone
        else but I realized that if I do, will I ever experience what love
        actually is? Of course it comes in many forms. As I started to get to
        know you more, the more I see the real you. 
        <br><br>
        We're not perfect beings, we
        make mistakes and we learn from it. Hearing from you makes me happy
        whether it's a bad day, good or boring, just hearing your voice is
        enough. Despite the distance I'm willing to love every part of you, the
        real you. So many days have passed, I've gotten to know you more. You
        care, your kind, despite with what you've gone through, you still manage
        to keep going. <br><br>
        
        Please don't say you're a bad person. I see you
        differently, you are real, raw, I know it sounds weird but I see you
        with no filter, you are able to open up to me and it means a lot that
        you are able to trust me enough to tell me your problems. I know I need
        to work on that as well, to tell you my problems too, it is unfair that
        you are able to tell me yours when I myself can't even tell you. I'm
        sorry, it takes time for me to tell you my problems. Thank you for being
        here with me, for encouraging me to be better too. I'm getting nervous
        as our special day is coming. <br><br>
        
        I've started to realize that my feelings
        have deepened... you showed me what you really are, not entirely
        everything but by pieces, I know we are far from each other but I'm
        willing to keep this going and make us more than what we are now.
